## ðŸ“– Overview

This repository contains a data analysis of 200 students to predict final exam scores. Using a regression model, it explores the trade-off between study hours and sleep to identify the most efficient strategies for academic success. The key output is a "trade-off frontier" plot that provides actionable coaching guidance for both students and educators.
